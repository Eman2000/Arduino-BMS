# Arduino-BMS
This is the arduino code for my 3s Li-ion battery management system project. The folder named STM contains versions of the code that are meant to run on Blue Pill devalopment boards which use STM32F103C8 microcontrollers. 

For information on the project please look into my YouTube Videos about it:
